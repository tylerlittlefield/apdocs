Here, you can find everything you need to know about ArborPro software. If you are reading this, we assume you already have ArborPro software and are ready to dive into the details. However, if this isn’t the case and you are simply interested in what the software has to offer, please contact us here. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 System Requirements 1.2 Tree Inventory Methodology", " Chapter 1 Introduction ArborPro assists forestry managers with managing their tree maintenance. The software incorporates a mapping component allowing the user to view, select, and locate trees or groups of trees. The dynamic link between the mapping component and the database provides a unique and powerful tool. 1.1 System Requirements ArborPro has the following system requirements: Windows 2000/XP/Vista/8/10 512MB RAM or greater 130MB disk space Additional disk space for mapping data Note: This can be up to many gigabytes for high-resolution aerial photography. 1.2 Tree Inventory Methodology Trees are located in the field using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The ground coordinates are recorded and used to determine several site characteristics, such as nearest street, zone, adjacent building, and so on. Additionally, a number of tree characteristics are assessed and recorded, including the height, diameter, structure, condition, and species of the tree. "],
["quick-references.html", "Chapter 2 Quick Reference 2.1 Recording Work", " Chapter 2 Quick Reference This chapter is the “too long, didn’t read” (TLDR) section of the documentation. It’s meant for users that want to know how to do stuff without diving into the knitty gritty details of it all. Additionally, you can skip to chapter 5 for further use cases. 2.1 Recording Work The most common task involves recording work done on trees. The workflow changes depending on whether or not we are recording work for a single tree or multiple trees. 2.1.1 One Tree To record work done on a single tree: Open ArborPro. Locate the tree that needs work done to it. You have two options for locating the tree: Search by characteristics or by simply zooming into the area of interest. Click on the Identify (“i”) tool and click on the tree. Select the Work History tab. The list on the left side shows all recorded work that has been completed for this tree. Click on the new work record button. Fill in all the information on the right, click the Save button, and press . There are three dates: Date refers to the current date, i.e. the date entered. Scheduled is a scheduled date and Completed is the date the work was actually done. Click the triangle next to each date field to see a calendar. This new work history record has now been added to the tree. If any crews or work types need to be modified, use the Edit &gt; Maintenance Options menu to add or edit these items. 2.1.2 Multiple Trees To record work done on multiple trees: Open ArborPro. Locate the trees that require work. Simliar to the above, we have two options: Using the select tool or search by characteristics1. Click on the “Inventory” tab and click on the “List” button2. The New List window appears. This allows you to save the selected trees to a list. Enter the work code, sub code, crew, notes, and date the work was completed. Click “OK” to apply that work to all trees in the list. If you need to specify different dates the work was done, do not fill in a completion date and go to Step 5. To fill in individual dates for work done, click on the List in the left side. It will appear under the “Open Lists” since a completion date was not specified. Drag the scroll bar at the bottom all the way to the right to see the Date column. Click on an empty date box and enter the date, i.e. “1/20/18”. Use the Down Arrow key on your keyboard to automatically fill in the same date on the next row. Click on the “Save” button to finish. The select tool can be used to draw a box on the map to highlight several trees, or click on individual trees one-by-one. See the chapter 3 for more information on how the select tool works.↩ A list allows you to apply work done to many trees, without having to enter work history individually for each tree. This can be a substantial time saver if you perform work on many trees at a time.↩ "],
["tools.html", "Chapter 3 Tools 3.1 Tool Details", " Chapter 3 Tools We describe the tools ArborPro has to offer in this chapter. These tools can be broken down into two categories: editing tools and navigation tools. Editing tools allow users to modify the data and navigations tools allow users to navigate the map and locate specific trees. Below is a table that quickly summarises the tools: Tool Description Full Extent Zoom to the full map extent as defined by user Zoom Previous Zoom to previous map extent Zoom Next Zoom to the next map extent (assuming you’ve rolled back to a previous map extent) Zoom In Zoom in closer to the map image Zoom Out Zoom out farther away from map image Pan ‘Pan and scan’ the map by clicking and dragging the cursor Select Select trees by point and click, marquee selection, or polygon selection Identify Open the tree detail window of a tree Measure Measure distances Add Tree Add trees (points) to the map Add Polygon Draw polygons on the map Move Point Move trees (points) from one location to another Site Numbering Manually renumber tree sites Clear Selection Clear the current selected trees Print Map Print a map List Create a list 3.1 Tool Details We’ve dedicated a section for each tool to go over in more detail. 3.1.1 Full Extent When you open ArborPro it displays the default map extent. Users can modify that extent by going to Tools then selecting Set Default Map Extent. The current map displayed will now be the default map view everytime ArborPro is opened. Often times, a tree inventory spans many miles and users will spend the day working on multiple areas in the map. As a result, zooming out can become time consuming. This is where the Full Extent tool becomes useful, when users need to quickly zoom into an area, do some work and then zoom back out to the full extent so that they can zoom into a different area on the map. To zoom back to the full map view, simply click the Full Extent tool. 3.1.2 Zoom Previous This is another navigation tool that takes users to the previous map extent. Occasionally, users might zoom into an area on accident in which case, they want to go back to the previous map view. This is why the Zoom Previous tool exists. 3.1.3 Zoom Next The Zoom Next tool is nearly identical to the Zoom Previous tool except it sends the user to the next map extent. 3.1.4 Zoom In One of the most important navigation tools, this allows users to zoom into specific areas on the map. This can be done in two ways: point and click or drawing a box to zoom into the area inside that box3. 3.1.5 Zoom Out Similar to the Zoom In tool with two exceptions: this zooms the user out and you may only point and click to zoom out. 3.1.6 Pan The pan tool lets users “pan and scan”, i.e. it lets users point, click, and drag the map in a specific direction. Click on this tool to recenter the map. The mouse pointer will become a hand - click the map and move it in any direction. 3.1.7 Select The select tool allows users to select trees in three ways: point and click, polygon select, box select. 3.1.8 Identify The Identify tool allows users to inspect the details of a tree. One the tool is selected, clicking a tree will open the Tree Detail window which displays tree characterists and work history. 3.1.9 Measure The measure tool allows users to measure distances. 3.1.10 Add Tree Click this tool then click on the map to add a new tree. By default, the characteristics in the Detail form are taken from the nearest tree. This simplifies the data input as typically just a few things need to be changed. Remember to click on the Save button to save these characteristics. 3.1.11 Add Polygon Click this tool then click on the map to add a new polygon. If trees are the currently selected group to the left of the map or if trees are the only option, this polygon becomes a Tree Stand. 3.1.12 Move Point Click this tool when there are one or more trees selected to move the selected trees. Click on the map, hold the mouse button down, then move the mouse and release the mouse button. All selected trees are moved that distance. If there are selected trees outside the map view, ArborPro asks whether you wish to move them too. 3.1.13 Site Numbering Click this tool to manually assign site numbers to trees. One the tool is selected the cursor will turn into a pencil - begin clicking points to renumber the sites. 3.1.14 Clear Selection Clear the selected (in red) and highlighted (in yellow) trees. This also removes the numbered dots on tree lists. 3.1.15 Print Map Click on this tool to print the map the way it currently looks in ArborPro. A neat line, logo, and text are included. Text on the bottom of the print page is specified beforehand using the File &gt; Page Setup menu. 3.1.16 List Editor Opens the List Edtitor to create a new list, delete the selected trees from a list, or add the selected trees to an existing list. The drawing a box method is often called Marquee Zoom.↩ "],
["interface.html", "Chapter 4 Interface 4.1 Main Components 4.2 Specialized Components", " Chapter 4 Interface This chapter discusses the softwares interface and is organized into two main parts: the broader main components of the interface and the smaller specialized components of the interface. We split this chapter into these two sections. 4.1 Main Components The main components of ArborPro can further be broken down into four sections: The map tab The inventory tab The left panel The tool bar In short, the map tab displays the map, the inventory tab displays the data as a spreadsheet, the left panel organizes properties and lists, and the tool bar organizes all available tools. We will go over all four components in more detail below. 4.1.1 The Map Tab 4.1.2 The Inventory Tab Selecting the inventory tab will display the data as a spreadsheet with columns and rows. For users comfortable with excel, the inventory tab should look pretty familiar4. 4.1.3 The Left Panel 4.1.4 The Tool Bar 4.2 Specialized Components Discuss things like the tree detail, map preferences, preferences, maintenance options, etc. Note that no data is displayed in the inventory view because the screenshot was taken from a fresh ArborPro install with an empty database.↩ "],
["applications.html", "Chapter 5 Applications 5.1 Identify Hazardous Trees 5.2 Build a Custom Report 5.3 Personalize Your Map 5.4 Export Data 5.5 Configure Maintenance Settings 5.6 Export/Import Maintenace Data 5.7 Mass Update", " Chapter 5 Applications Some significant applications are demonstrated in this chapter. Think of it as an ArborPro cookbook with recipes for completing tasks. 5.1 Identify Hazardous Trees Locating hazardous trees is a common use case for many ArborPro users. Identifying trees of any criteria (hazard or not) is itself and important and powerful tool. Querying your inventory requires the search tool and a solid understanding of the search tool is necessary to prioritize your work efficiently. To begin searching either use the hotkey Ctrl + F or follow these steps: Select Search in the top left-ish menu bar. From the Search drop down menu, select Characteristics. Having followed those steps, you should see a search window: From this point, you can find all hazardous trees selecting all trees with a Target Rating of Hazard: And that’s pretty much it. The search tool is very intuitive and more complex searches can be made with ease. You can get creative with your searches and add multiple characteristics to a single search. Some other common searches are: Search for a specific species Search for all trees within a DBH range Search by condition Search by update/inspected/gps date Search by recommended maintenance Search by condition in a specific zone Finally, it’s important to understand that the search tool is only as good as the data collected. This is similar to the Garbage In, Garbage Out concept where poorly collected data will make searching difficult. Conversly, properly collected data will provide better search results. For more on the importance of data collection, see chapter 6. 5.2 Build a Custom Report Out of the box, ArborPro provides numerous reports that are ready to be used. However, there may be times were you need a custom report with a specific set of fields. You may even need the sorting of those fields to behave in a specific way. 5.3 Personalize Your Map 5.4 Export Data 5.5 Configure Maintenance Settings 5.6 Export/Import Maintenace Data 5.7 Mass Update "],
